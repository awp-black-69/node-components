# node-components

Collection of Node components to be used in different project

# Installing as npm package dependencies in your project

`npm instal --save-dev git+https://github.com/vivek-brohma/node-components`

# Working in local

Any change in component here would require you to do a `npm update node-component` everytime.

To solve this use `npm link` inside "node-components" and do a `npm link node-components` inside your project.
